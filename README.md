# 👋 Hi, I’m @kratos47mhs

A passionate **DevOps Engineer** with hands-on experience in building, automating, and securing scalable infrastructure. I specialize in **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD**, **cloud-native technologies**, and **Linux system administration**.

  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and self-hosted DevOps stacks  
  - Distributed systems and high-availability architectures  
  - Observability and performance monitoring (Prometheus, Elastic Stack, Signoz)  
  - Event-driven systems with Kafka  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Advanced Kubernetes concepts (Operators, CRDs, GitOps)  
  - Secure multi-tenant PaaS/IaaS architecture (WISE project)  
  - Cloud-native service meshes and zero-trust networking  
  - Deeper integrations between CI/CD and infrastructure tooling  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Open-source DevOps and observability tools  
  - Migration projects from monolith to microservices
